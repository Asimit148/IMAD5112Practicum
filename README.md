## 🎨 Design Considerations

### 🔘 Buttons
- Consistent and purposeful color themes:
  - Green for **Add**
  - Blue for **Navigation**
  - Red for **Exit/Clear**
- Each button has a clearly defined role and action:
  - Welcome screen → Input screen (via “Get Started”)
  - Input screen → Display screen (via “Go to Display Screen”)
  - Exit buttons use `finishAffinity()` to close the app properly.

### ✍️ EditTexts
- Found on the Input screen:
  - Designed with hints to guide user input.
  - Padded and background-tinted for visibility.
  - `inputSleepHours` is numeric to restrict to numbers only.
  
### 📝 TextViews
- Welcome message
- Form title
- Display headers
- Outputs for emotion and sleep logs


---

## 🛠️ Usability and Error Handling
- Robust **input validation**:
  - Ensures fields are not empty.
  - Prevents invalid or non-numeric entries for sleep hours.
- Clear **Toast messages** guide the user through errors or success.
- Prevents app crashes from malformed inputs.

---

## 🎨 Personal Design Inspiration and Touches
- **Custom background images** were created for each screen, matching the theme of emotional tracking and reflection.
- **Color palette**:
  - Calming blues and greens.
  - Contrasting reds for alerts/actions.
- All UI components were styled for accessibility and comfort.
- Every layout was crafted with a consistent design language.


---
